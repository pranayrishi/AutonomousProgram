# VEX Robotics Odometry Autonomous Program
### This is the code that I have created for my VEX team for our Autonomous program which implements Odometry. Feel Free to use this code and adjust the KP based on your program. Our robot utilizes 2 blue motors for the drive train, one Odom pod that covers the X-axis and another odometry pod that covers the Y-Axis to track accurate movement.
